resource-type: product # options: product-model, family, any supported API aliases

extract:
    # Data source
    type: api # options api, csv, xlsx?

    # (optional)
    resource-type: product # options: product-model, family, any supported API aliases

    # filter for the API call (API related?)
    conditions:
        -

transform:
    # Update generation strategy
    # Options: patch, post (full)
    # Should it be a responsibility of the loader?
    type: patch

    actions: []

    # What to do if no actions
    # Option 1: stop - how to clone then?
    # Option 2: load full resource !!!

    # What are conditions to run FULL mode
    # only flag



    # Between transform and load there is a generation of a resource that will be sent to Akeneo

    ### Pro loader
    # - Loader knows if patch mode is supported or not
    # - Generating a patch is not a responsibility of the transformer

    # Loader can then generate an event onLoad with:
    # before
    # after
    # error for this particular resource

    # Soooo... one more "Pro"
    # - improved onLoadEvent with errors


    ### Pro transformer
    # - no need to send before and after to loader
    # OnTransform seemed to be a good thing (but see: - Generating a patch is not a responsibility of the transformer)




loader:
    # Destination
    # Options: dry-run, api, csv, xlsx?
    ### Question: is dry-run a property of loader?
    type: api

    # Options: patch (default), full
    mode: patch

    # (optional) API related? ot also csv?
